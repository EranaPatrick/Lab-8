<h1><center> The Alphabet </h1></center>

<p class="style"> Scholars attribute its origin to a little known Proto-Sinatic, Semitic form of writing developed in Egypt between 1800 and 1900 BC. Building on this ancient foundation, the first widely used alphabet was developed by the Phoenicians about seven hundred years later.</p>
<p class="letters">
 •'aleph, the ox, began as the image of an ox's head.  It represents a glottal stop before a vowel.  The Greeks, needing vowel symbols, used it for alpha (A).  The Romans used it as A.
 <br>
 <br>

•Beth, the house, may have derived from a more rectangular Egyptian alphabetic glyph of a reed shelter (but which stood for the sound h). The Greeks called it beta (B), and it was passed on to the Romans as B.
<br>
<br>
•Gimel, the camel, may have originally been the image of a boomerang-like throwing stick.  The Greeks called it gamma (Γ).  The Etruscans -- who had no g sound -- used it for the k sound, and passed it on to the Romans as C.  They in turn added a short bar to it to make it do double duty as G.
<br>
<br>
•Daleth, the door, may have originally been a fish!  The Greeks turned it into delta (Δ), and passed it on to the Romans as D.<
<br>
<br>
•He may have meant window, but originally represented a man, facing us with raised arms, calling out or praying.  The Greeks used it for the vowel epsilon (E, "simple E").  The Romans used it as E.
<br>
<br>
• 'the hook, may originally have represented a mace.  The Greeks used one version of waw which looked like our F, which they called digamma, for the number 6.  This was used by the Etruscans for v, and they passed it on to the Romans as F.   The Greeks had a second version -- upsilon (Υ)-- which they moved to to the back of their alphabet.  The Romans used a version of upsilon for V, which later would be written U as well, then adopted the Greek form as Y.  In 7th century England, the W -- "double-u" -- was created.
<br>
<br>
•Zayin may have meant sword or some other kind of weapon.  The Greeks used it for zeta (Z). The Romans only adopted it later as Z, and put it at the end of their alphabet.
<br>
<br>
•H.eth, the fence, was a "deep throat" (pharyngeal) consonant.  The Greeks used it for the vowel eta (H), but the Romans used it for H.
<br>
<br>
•Teth may have originally represented a spindle.  The Greeks used it for theta (Θ), but the Romans, who did not have the th sound, dropped it.
<br>
<br>
•Yodh, the hand, began as a representation of the entire arm.  The Greeks used a highly simplified version of it for iota (Ι).  The Romans used it as I, and later added a variation for J.
<br>
<br>
•Kaph, the hollow or palm of the hand, was adopted by the Greeks for kappa (K) and passed it on to the Romans as K.
<br>
<br>
•Lamedh began as a picture of an ox stick or goad. The Greeks used it for lambda (Λ).  The Romans turned it into L.
<br>
<br>
•Mem, the water, became the Greek mu (M).  The Romans kept it as M.
<br>
<br>
•Nun, the fish, was originally a snake or eel.  The Greeks used it for nu (N), and the Romans for N.
<br>
<br>
•Samekh, which also meant fish, is of uncertain origin.  It may have originally represented a tent peg or some kind of support.  It bears a strong resemblance to the Egyptian djed pillar seen in many sacred carvings.  The Greeks used it for xi (Ξ) and a simplified variation of it for chi (X).  The Romans kept only the variation as X.
<br>
<br>
•'ayin, the eye, was another "deep throat" consonant.  The Greeks used it for omicron (O, "little O").  They developed a variation of it for omega (Ω, "big O"), and put it at the end of their alphabet.  The Romans kept the original for O.
<br>
<br>
•Pe, the mouth, may have originally been a symbol for a corner.  The Greeks used it for pi (Π).  The Romans closed up one side and turned it into P.
<br>
<br>
•Sade, a sound between s and sh, is of uncertain origin.  It may have originally been a symbol for a plant, but later looks more like a fish hook.  The Greeks did not use it, although an odd variation does show up as sampi (Ϡ), a symbol for 900.  The Etruscans used it in the shape of an M for their sh sound, but the Romans had no need for it.
<br>
<br>
•Qoph, the monkey, may have originally represented a knot.  It was used for a sound similar to k but further back in the mouth.  The Greeks only used it for the number 90 (Ϙ), but the Etruscans and Romans kept it for Q.
<br>
<br>
•Resh, the head, was used by the Greeks for rho (P).  The Romans added a line to differentiate it from their P and made it R.
<br>
<br>
•Shin, the tooth, may have originally represented a bow.  Although it was first pronounced sh, the Greeks used it sideways for sigma (Σ).  The Romans rounded it to make S.
<br>
<br>
•Taw, the mark, was used by the Greeks for tau (T).  The Romans used it for T.
